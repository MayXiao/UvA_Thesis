Master thesis Title: Advancing Cross-Cultural Comics: Developing Robust Image Embedding Models for Accurate Measurement of Comic Similarity

Abstract:
In this study, we address the growing importance of comics in cross-cultural contexts and the need for robust image-embedding models that are culturally sensitive and capable of precisely assessing the similarity between comic images originating from different cultural backgrounds. We propose the identification of an optimal image representation technique that extracts essential features from comics using unsupervised and supervised learning. Our approach assumes that images originating from the same comic book will exhibit greater similarities than those from distinct books. We draw on state-of-the-art advancements in computer vision and cross-cultural studies to develop and evaluate new embedding models specifically for comic images that address the challenges of comic similarity in cross-cultural contexts. Our study makes a significant contribution to the field by furthering our comprehension of comic similarities and their role within cross-cultural domains. We explore factors such as location and time period analysis, thereby enhancing our understanding of comic similarities in cross-cultural contexts. Our research findings have potential applications in areas such as cultural studies, media studies, and digital humanities.
